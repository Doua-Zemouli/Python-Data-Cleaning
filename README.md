# Python-Data-Cleaning  

This is a learning project where we will work with a messy call center dataset (provided in the repository). We will have to clean it by doing the following:  
-Have a first look at the data      
-Removing duplicates    
-Dropping irrelevant columns  
-Standardizing columns and unification of format using strip, replace, fill null...  
-Handeling missing data as well as filtering rows based on business requirements
